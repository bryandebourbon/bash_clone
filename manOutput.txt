they will be displayed with their full path.

Syntax: find REGEX PATH ...
}

get
{
Retrieves the file at the given web address and adds it to the current directory.

Examples:

a) get http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~spok/grimmtmp/073.txt
Will get the contents of the file i.e. 073.txt and add it to the current
directory.

grep
{
The grep command is used to print any any lines that contain REGEX in the given path,
which must be a file if the optional parameter is not supplied.

If the [-R] optional parameter is supplied, and the given path is a directory, the directory will be
transversed through recursively. For all lines in all files that contain REGEX, the path of the file
will be printed, and then the line that contained REGEX.

Syntax: grep REGEX PATH ...
	grep [-R] REGEX PATH ...
}

ls
{
The ls (list) command is used to display the contents of directories. If no paths are specified in the command call, the contents
of the current directory will be displayed. Otherwise, the contents of each specified directory will be displayed. Note that
if any of the parameters are files, only the file name will be displayed.

The [-R] optional parameter is used to recursively list any directories (or files) found as sub directories/files of the specified
paths. If no paths are specified, the current directory will be used by default.

Syntax: ls
	ls [PATH ...]
	ls [-R]
	ls [-R] [PATH ...]
}

The pwd (print working directory) command is used to display the current directory in the JShell. This is helpful for navigation
purposes.

	rm [-f] PATH ...
}
